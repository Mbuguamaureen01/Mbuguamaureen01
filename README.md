## Hey there 👋🏾

I’m **Maureen Mbugua** — an **AI / Machine Learning Engineer** and **Data Engineer** based in **Nairobi, Kenya 🇰🇪**, passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world business problems.

My journey started in **data analytics and BI**, working with SQL, Excel, and dashboards. Over time, I transitioned into **data engineering**, and today I focus on **production AI systems** — especially **RAG-based AI agents**, **ML deployment**, and **scalable data pipelines**.

### 🔍 A little about me...

I began by wrangling spreadsheets, writing SQL queries, and building Power BI dashboards to support decision-making. As I explored Machine Learning and automation, I discovered a deeper interest in **end-to-end systems** — not just models, but how they integrate with real data, users, and operations.

Fast-forward to today, I’m:

- 🤖 **Building production-grade AI agents** using the **LangChain / LangGraph ecosystem**
- 🧠 Designing **RAG-based conversational systems** grounded in domain knowledge
- 🗄️ Working with **MongoDB** for memory & persistence and **Qdrant** as a vector database
- ⚙️ Deploying AI & ML systems with **Python + FastAPI**
- 📊 Engineering scalable **data pipelines** and analytics solutions for **38+ retail stores**
- 🔁 Automating business workflows across inventory, forecasting, and reporting

### 🧪 Lately into...

These days you’ll find me deep into **Generative AI and agentic systems** — designing AI assistants that integrate **LLMs with structured business data**, real-time inventory, and knowledge bases.

One example is an **AI-powered virtual assistant for retail health stores**, built with:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LangChain / LangGraph
- MongoDB (long-term memory)
- Qdrant (vector search)
- FastAPI (production API layer)

I enjoy building systems that go beyond demos — **AI that actually runs in production** and creates measurable impact.
